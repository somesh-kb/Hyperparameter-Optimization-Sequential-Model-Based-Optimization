# Materials-Science-Data-Analysis

This repository is dedicated to hyperparameter optimization. The data used for this project is a Ni alloy dataset (from materials science) compiled by the National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), Tsukuba, Japan. This dataset cannot be made public due to intellectual property rights. The objective is to demonstrate hyperparameter optimization for several machine learning (ML) models. Two primary hyperparameter optimization techniques were used: (a) Random Search, and (b) Sequential Model-Based Optimization (SMBO). In both cases, a ten-fold cross validation approach was considered. In SMBO, the Tree-Parzen Estimator (TPE) method was used. The different ML models used are (i) Support Vector Machines, (ii) Random Forest, (iii) Gradient Boosting, and (iv) Extreme Gradient Boosting. The TPE provides a much better set of hyperparameters as shown by the corresponding metrics viz. coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean squared error (RMSE).
